I am putting the binaries I have received for analysis purpose.  
It won't work with your files since the key is embedded inside the binaries and is unique.  
Normally it won't harm your computer (at least on Windows and linux) if you lauch them but since I haven't decompiled for all platforms.  
I cannot guarantee that there is not a virus inside.
